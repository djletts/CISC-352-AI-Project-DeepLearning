Project Discription:
This project is for Queen's University CISC 325 Artificial Intelligence for the Winter 2025 semester taught by Dr. Christian Muise. The semester long assignment is to code 3 different AI agents (CSP, Planning, Deep Learning) to solve a nonogram puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram). The nonograms that we are interested in are nxn grids and single colour (filled or blank). Each row and col has a key that tells you how many squares are coloured in a row. For this specific part, we have created a neural network capable of solving 5x5 nonograms.

Nicole Hernandez and Dylan Letts coded this project together. Each commit, regardless of who pushed, was worked on by both of us on one computer.
